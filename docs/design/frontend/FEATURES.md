# AgentSight Frontend Features

## Core Capabilities

### 1. **Real-time AI Agent Monitoring**
- **Live dashboard** with agent status, performance metrics, and alerts
- **System-level visibility** into agent behavior without code instrumentation
- **Multi-agent coordination** tracking across complex workflows
- **Resource monitoring** (CPU, memory, network) correlated with AI operations

### 2. **Comprehensive Trace Visualization**
- **Hierarchical trace trees** showing conversation → LLM calls → system events
- **Interactive timelines** with zoom, filter, and correlation capabilities
- **System boundary capture** of file I/O, network calls, process execution
- **TLS traffic interception** showing actual prompts and responses

### 3. **Security & Compliance Monitoring**
- **Prompt injection detection** with real-time threat analysis
- **Access control monitoring** for file and network operations
- **Policy compliance** tracking and violation alerts
- **Audit trails** for security investigations and forensics

### 4. **Performance Analytics**
- **Response time analysis** with percentile distributions
- **Cost tracking** across different LLM providers and models
- **Resource usage correlation** with AI operations
- **Bottleneck identification** and optimization suggestions

### 5. **Advanced Search & Filtering**
- **Natural language search** across all agent data
- **Pattern recognition** for similar issues and behaviors
- **Cross-reference capabilities** linking events across agents
- **Historical analysis** and trend identification
